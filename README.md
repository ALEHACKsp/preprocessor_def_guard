# preprocessor_def_guard 

Simple little script to enumerate a file for specific preprocessor definitions and adds a guard around them.

Example of the outcome of this script can be seen in the example [ntstatus.h](https://github.com/dude719/preprocessor_def_guard/blob/master/ntstatus.h)

Usage:

    python preprocessor_def_guard.py [-i|--input-file=<inputfile>] [-o|--output-file=<outputfile>]
